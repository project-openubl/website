_XBuilder Server_ is a Microservice that can create XML files based on the [Universal Bussiness Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Business_Language) (UBL). It is based on [XBuilder](https://project-openubl.github.io/xbuilder-docs/)

## Features

_XBuilder Server_ is based on [XBuilder](https://project-openubl.github.io/xbuilder-docs/) so it offers the same core funtionalities. However, _XBuilder Server_ offers additional features that allows you to deploy it across different cloud platforms or bare-metals.

## Design principles
- **Easy integration** - _XBuilder Server_ allows easy integration with any third party software regardless of their programing language or architecture.
- **Hybrid** - _XBuilder Server_ can be deployed in mutiple cloud platforms or bare-metals. You can go to the cloud and use container images and/or go as serveless. If the cloud if not for you then you can always deploy _XBuilder Server_ in your own datacenter.
- **XBuilder Sync** - _XBuilder Server_ supports 100% of features of XBuilder so whenever a new feature or bug is solved into XBuilder you will have it for free.

## How XBuilder works

We believe that you should provide as minimal data as possible and then allow XBuilder to do the rest for you. The input data provided by whoever uses XBuilder is not based in UBL but based in common and mainstream bussiness language.
